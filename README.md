# Happy Birthday to you, Mommy!

Yo lo, I have made this website for like idk 5 months above, because i have school work to do so, I kept procastinating this project until I finished my semester and started working on it again till finished it.
Well, about her, she is a cooking lover. She has done so many thing about cooking and is really into baking! Yes, she can bake cookies, makes a cake with even art design and everything! She is currently creating profits by selling mooncakes via wholesale when the Mid-autum month comes and she is serious with it. Therefore, I developed this website and deployed it successfully! (the sending orders system works! XD)

Mom, I love you very much. I invested some part of my time and merit for you. Hope you love my gift and HAPPY BIRTHDAYYYYYY!!!

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
